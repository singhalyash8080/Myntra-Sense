# Myntra-Sense

We propose a seamless and easy-to-use feature called SENSE using which customers can upload a photo of any piece of clothing they already own and easily get expert recommendations of clothing that goes along with it. Our product will categorize thousands of products based on parameters like color and category. This feature can help in the discovery of certain products which suit an individual and reduce window shopping time. 
Instead of just shopping for separate and individual items, they can shop for clothes to complete their outfit. For each image of clothing item uploaded customers will get clothes that are similar to that item and also clothing items that can be worn with them.

### The technology  used in the application includes 

 - Frontend -ReactJS,Redux state management, TS
